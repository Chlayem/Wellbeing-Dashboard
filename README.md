# Wellbeing Dashboard

## üåê Overview
This project was part of my educational journey at **ENSI** named **"Design and Development Project"**.

It was a fantastic opportunity to dive into web and mobile development, gaining hands-on experience with frontend development using **Flutter** and **Firebase**, as well as UI design using **Figma**.

## üìã Description
The Wellbeing Dashboard application aims to enhance employee health and well-being, which are crucial for the efficient functioning of a company.
Healthier and happier employees are more productive and satisfied with their work. By providing tools for HR managers and therapists, this application helps companies improve their employees' well-being, leading to reduced absenteeism, turnover, and associated costs.

The application includes:
- A dashboard for HR managers to set well-being goals and visualize overall and departmental well-being metrics.
- An interface for therapists to access employees' personal and emotional data to provide better support.
